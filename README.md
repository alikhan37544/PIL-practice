# PIL-practice

This is just me getting accoustomed to the PIL software while also getting into the habit of maintaining a github commit and upload streak :)



Few notes are : 
The VS Code compiler seemed to save the images directly to the main folder, maybe because that's where my debugging is configured. I'm not sure why, but specifying the file relative to the main folder works just as well

While specifying the position, one has to make sure to account string formatting, especially escape characters
